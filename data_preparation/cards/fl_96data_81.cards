C ***** ZEUS MAGNETIC FIELD CARDS
c
c   New magnetic field maps were introduced in Jan. 1992.
c   These maps are substantially more detailed than the old 2-D "Frascati"
c   map that has been used so far.
c   Preliminary documentation (by Silvia Limentani) can be found in:
c           VXDESY::ZRDOCU:GUFLDNEW.DOC 
c
c   Two new cards, MAP and MSCALE, have been introduced to access/process
c   the new maps.
c   See ZG313T4 Pam file, P=COMMENT,D=COMCARD and COMMAPS.  
c
c        MAP  2 0  reads the _SCA version.
c        MAP  2 1  reads the _SCB version.
c        MAP  . . 0     : not used at the moment
c        MAP  . . . >0  : produces detailed print-out at initialisation.
c             . . .  .
ZEUSBFLD-MAP  2 0 0  0
c
c          MSCALE allows the possibility of scaling each of the 11 sub-maps.
c                 The scaling factor is integerised with 1000 -> 1.0
c                 The default value is 1000 (i.e. 1.0) for each MAP.
c                 The regions covered by the 11 maps are:
c     Map 1  covers the volume inside the yoke with relatively coarse
c            granularity; it is the default. 
c     Map 2  covers the compensator region;
c     Map 3  covers the central tracking detectors, solenoid
c            and immediate surroundings;
c     Map 4  covers the toroid region;
c     Map 5  covers the forward endcap of the yoke;
c     Map 6  covers the rear endcap of the yoke;
c                                                         ^
c     Map 7      \                                        |y
c         8      |                                       _7__
c         9       > - they cover the barrel yoke,      8/    \8
c        10      |    according to the schema:        9|      |9  -x->
c        11      /                                    10\____/10
c                                                         11
c  It follows that the 11 scale-factors are not all independent:
c       1 and 3 MUST be the same scale-factors,
c  and  5 through 11 should probably be the same, but there may be 
c                    some non-linearities. (This is all being checked.)
c  NOTE !!
c  use D911018I5000_SC*.MAPS only to run ZEPHYR on old MOZART.DATA, which
c  were generated with D911018I5000_SC*.MAPS !!!!! 
c  An APPROXIMATION for 1.5T, starting from D911018I5000_SC*.MAPS is given by:
c  
c                 Central     comp.  toroid    Yokes
C ZEUSBFLD-MSCALE 1=833 3=833   2=833  4=833    5=7*833
c
c  An APPROXIMATION for 1.5T, starting from S3955C889Y3000_SC*.MAPS is given by:
C                                    
c                    Central     comp.  toroid    Yokes
c ZEUSBFLD-MSCALE 1=1049 3=1049  2=833  4=1000   5=7*1000 
c
c  For 'DAY 1' use S3955C889Y3000_SC*.MAPS which corresponds to 1.43T and:
c
c                  Central     comp.  toroid    Yokes
ZEUSBFLD-MSCALE 1=1000 3=1000  2=792  4=1000   5=7*1000 
c
c One cannot yet turn all fields OFF by the MSCALE card, though this will
c be made possible. At the moment one turns fields off by the ZG3xxTn-EXCO 
c card:
c             >0: Field OFF 
c ZG3xxTn-EXCO 1
